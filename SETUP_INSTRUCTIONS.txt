## 🚀 Option 1: Clean Current Repository (Recommended)

Run the automated script:

```bash
cd /home/incygnia/Downloads/jau-new
./setup-review-repo.sh
```

This will:
1. Remove tracked files that should be ignored
2. Stage only the files you want to share
3. Show you what will be committed

Then commit and push to a new remote:

```bash
# Commit the clean version
git commit -m "Prepare repository for code review"

# Add new remote repository (create one first on GitHub)
git remote add review https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/jau-review.git

# Push to the new repository
git push review main
```

---

## 🚀 Option 2: Create Fresh Repository Copy

If you want to start completely fresh:

```bash
# Clone the current repo to a new directory
cd /home/incygnia/Downloads
git clone jau-new jau-review
cd jau-review

# Remove git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize fresh repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for code review"

# Create new repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/jau-review.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📝 After Uploading

1. Rename `README-REVIEW.md` to `README.md` in the new repository
2. The IT expert will only see:
   - Frontend and backend code
   - Package configurations
   - Build scripts
   - NO documentation, SQL files, or migrations

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The `.gitignore` file is already configured properly
- `build.js` is explicitly included (won't be ignored)
- Make sure to create the new GitHub repository BEFORE pushing
- You can make the new repository private if needed
- The original repository remains unchanged

---

## 🧪 Verify What Will Be Shared

Before pushing, check what files are tracked:

```bash
git ls-files
```

This shows exactly what will be in the new repository.
